## 🏡 House Price Prediction (California Housing Dataset)

This project predicts house prices in California using machine learning models.
It uses the California Housing dataset from Scikit-learn and demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow:
data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn & Matplotlib

Outlier detection and handling

Feature engineering:

Log transforms for skewed features (MedInc, Population, AveBedrms)

Derived features like rooms per household, bedrooms per room, etc.

Scaling with StandardScaler / RobustScaler

Regression modeling (Linear Regression, etc.)

Model evaluation with RMSE and R² score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

## 📈 Results

R² Score: ~0.60 (Linear Regression)

RMSE: ~0.73

💡 With advanced models (RandomForest, XGBoost, GradientBoosting), accuracy can be improved further.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Clone the repository:
